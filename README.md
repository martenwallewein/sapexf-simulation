## Overview

This simulation framework models the SCION (Scalability, Control, and Isolation On Next-generation networks) architecture, focusing on:

- **Path Construction Beaconing (PCB)**: Realistic SCION beaconing protocol for path discovery
- **AS-level Topology**: Inter-domain routing with core and non-core ASes
- **Path Selection**: Pluggable algorithms for selecting paths between ASes
- **Traffic Simulation**: Configurable traffic flows with realistic network delays
- **Performance Metrics**: Packet loss, latency, and throughput measurements

The framework uses [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/) for discrete event simulation, providing accurate timing and resource modeling.

```

## How It Works

### 1. SCION Beaconing Protocol

The simulation implements the SCION path discovery mechanism:

#### Beacon Origination (Core ASes)

Core ASes periodically send Path Construction Beacons (PCBs) to their neighbors:

```python
# From beaconing.py
beacon = BeaconPacket(
    origin_router_id=self.start_router.node_id,
    origin_as_id=self.origin_as
)
# Send to all neighbors every 1000ms (configurable)
```

#### Beacon Propagation

When a router receives a beacon:

1. **AS-level Loop Detection**: Check if the current AS is already in the beacon's path
2. **Hop Information Addition**: Add AS ID, router ID, interfaces, and link metrics
3. **Path Registration**: Register the discovered path in the local path store
4. **Forwarding**: Forward the beacon to neighbors (excluding loops)

```python
# From components.py - Router.receive_packet()
if packet.is_beacon:
    as_path = packet.get_as_path()
    if current_as in as_path:
        return  # Drop beacon (loop detected)

    # Add this hop to the beacon
    packet.add_hop(as_id, router_id, ingress_if, link_metrics)

    # Register the path
    beaconing_process.register_path(packet, self.node_id)

    # Forward to neighbors
    for neighbor_id, link in self.ports.items():
        if neighbor_id not in packet.path:
            link.enqueue(packet.clone())
```

#### Path Combination

For inter-leaf communication, the framework automatically combines:
- **Up-segments**: Non-core AS � Core AS
- **Down-segments**: Core AS � Non-core AS

Example: To reach AS 112 from AS 111:
```
AS 111 � AS 110 (core) � AS 112
[up-segment]  [down-segment]
```

### 2. Path Selection

Applications query the path selection algorithm for paths between source and destination ASes:

```python
# From application.py
path = self.path_selector.select_path(self.source.isd_as, self.destination.isd_as)
```

The `ShortestPathAlgorithm` selects the path with minimum hop count, but you can implement custom algorithms.

### 3. Packet Forwarding

Data packets follow the selected path hop-by-hop:

```python
# From components.py - Router.receive_packet()
current_hop_index = packet.path.index(self.node_id)
next_hop = packet.path[current_hop_index + 1]
self.ports[next_hop].enqueue(packet)
```

### 4. Network Delays

The simulation models realistic network delays:

- **Propagation Delay**: Based on link latency (e.g., 10ms)
- **Transmission Delay**: Based on packet size and bandwidth
- **Processing Delay**: Implicit in event scheduling

```python
# From components.py - Link.run()
yield self.env.timeout(self.latency)  # Propagation delay
transmission_delay = (packet.size * 8) / (self.bandwidth * 1000)
yield self.env.timeout(transmission_delay)  # Transmission delay
```

## Configuration

### Topology Configuration (topology.json)

Define the network structure with ASes, routers, hosts, and links:

```json
{
  "1-ff00:0:110": {
    "core": true,
    "border_routers": {
      "br1-110-1": {
        "interfaces": [
          {
            "isd_as": "1-ff00:0:111",
            "neighbor_router": "br1-111-1",
            "latency_ms": 10,
            "bandwidth_mbps": 100
          }
        ]
      }
    },
    "hosts": {
      "server1": {
        "addr": "192.168.0.1"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Topology Format

- **AS Identifier**: `ISD-ASff00:ASN` format (e.g., `1-ff00:0:110`)
- **Core Flag**: `"core": true` for core ASes, `false` for non-core
- **Border Routers**: Dictionary of router names to interface configurations
- **Interfaces**: Define links to neighboring ASes with latency and bandwidth
- **Hosts**: End hosts within the AS with IP addresses

### Traffic Configuration (traffic.json)

Define traffic flows between hosts:

```json
{
  "duration_ms": 10000,
  "flows": [
    {
      "name": "WebServerTraffic",
      "source": "1-ff00:0:111,10.0.0.5",
      "destination": "1-ff00:0:112,172.16.5.5",
      "start_time_ms": 1000,
      "data_size_kb": 5000
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Traffic Format

- **duration_ms**: Total simulation time in milliseconds
- **flows**: List of traffic flows
  - **name**: Flow identifier for logging
  - **source**: Source host in format `AS,IP`
  - **destination**: Destination host in format `AS,IP`
  - **start_time_ms**: When the flow starts (ms)
  - **data_size_kb**: Total data to transfer (KB)

## Implementing Custom Algorithms

Create your own path selection algorithm by extending `PathSelectionAlgorithm`:

### Step 1: Create Your Algorithm Class

```python
# my_algorithm.py
from path_selection import PathSelectionAlgorithm

class MyCustomAlgorithm(PathSelectionAlgorithm):
    def __init__(self, topology, use_beaconing=True):
        super().__init__(topology)
        self.use_beaconing = use_beaconing
        self.discover_paths(use_graph_traversal=not use_beaconing)
        # Add custom initialization here

    def select_path(self, source_as, destination_as):
        """
        Select the best path from source to destination AS.

        Args:
            source_as: Source AS identifier (e.g., "1-ff00:0:111")
            destination_as: Destination AS identifier

        Returns:
            List of router IDs representing the path, or None if no path exists
        """
        available_paths = self.path_store.get((source_as, destination_as), [])
        if not available_paths:
            return None

        # Example: Select path with lowest total latency
        best_path = None
        min_latency = float('inf')

        for path in available_paths:
            total_latency = self._calculate_path_latency(path)
            if total_latency < min_latency:
                min_latency = total_latency
                best_path = path

        return best_path

    def _calculate_path_latency(self, path):
        """Calculate total latency for a path"""
        total = 0
        for i in range(len(path) - 1):
            current_router = path[i]
            next_router = path[i + 1]
            # Get link latency from topology
            if self.topology.graph.has_edge(current_router, next_router):
                latency = self.topology.graph[current_router][next_router].get('latency', 0)
                total += latency
        return total
```

### Step 2: Use Your Algorithm

Modify `main.py`:

```python
from my_algorithm import MyCustomAlgorithm

# Replace ShortestPathAlgorithm with your algorithm
sim = Simulation(args.topology, args.traffic, MyCustomAlgorithm)
```

### Available Information

Your algorithm has access to:

- **self.path_store**: Dictionary of discovered paths
  - Key: `(source_as, destination_as)` tuple
  - Value: List of paths (each path is a list of router IDs)

- **self.topology**: The network topology with:
  - `topology.graph`: NetworkX graph with routers and links
  - `topology.nodes`: Dictionary of all network nodes
  - Link attributes: `latency`, `bandwidth`

### Algorithm Guidelines

1. **Use Beaconing**: Set `use_beaconing=True` to rely on realistic path discovery
2. **Handle Missing Paths**: Return `None` if no path exists
3. **Return Router-level Path**: Path must be a list of router IDs in order
4. **Consider Metrics**: Access link metrics from beacon `HopInfo` objects
5. **Stateful Algorithms**: Store state in instance variables for adaptive selection

## Output and Metrics

### Console Output

The simulation provides detailed logging:

1. **Beaconing Phase** (0-2000ms by default):
   - Beacon transmission events
   - Path registration messages
   - Combined path creation

2. **Path Discovery Summary**:
   - All discovered paths between AS pairs
   - Router-level paths for data forwarding

3. **Traffic Phase**:
   - Application start events
   - Path selection results
   - Packet transmission/reception (if verbose)

4. **Results Summary**:
   - Total packets sent/received/lost
   - Packet loss rate (%)
   - Average end-to-end latency (ms)

### Accessing Detailed Results

Modify `simulation.py` to capture additional metrics:

```python
# In Simulation class
def print_results(self):
    print("\n--- Simulation Results ---")
    # Access detailed latency data
    latencies = self.results['latencies']
    if latencies:
        print(f"Min Latency: {min(latencies):.2f}ms")
        print(f"Max Latency: {max(latencies):.2f}ms")
        print(f"Median Latency: {sorted(latencies)[len(latencies)//2]:.2f}ms")
```

## Examples

### Example 1: Simple Star Topology

The default `topology.json` creates a star topology:

```
        AS 111 (client1)
             |
             | 10ms, 100Mbps
             |
        AS 110 (core)
             |
             | 20ms, 50Mbps
             |
        AS 112 (client2)
```

Traffic flows from AS 111 to AS 112 through the core AS 110.

### Example 2: Adding a New AS

Add a new AS to `topology.json`:

```json
"1-ff00:0:113": {
  "core": false,
  "border_routers": {
    "br1-113-1": {
      "interfaces": [
        {
          "isd_as": "1-ff00:0:110",
          "neighbor_router": "br1-110-1",
          "latency_ms": 15,
          "bandwidth_mbps": 75
        }
      ]
    }
  },
  "hosts": {
    "client3": {
      "addr": "10.0.0.10"
    }
  }
}
```

Update the core AS to include the new link:

```json
"1-ff00:0:110": {
  "core": true,
  "border_routers": {
    "br1-110-1": {
      "interfaces": [
        // ... existing interfaces ...
        {
          "isd_as": "1-ff00:0:113",
          "neighbor_router": "br1-113-1",
          "latency_ms": 15,
          "bandwidth_mbps": 75
        }
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

### Example 3: Latency-Based Path Selection

Create a latency-optimized algorithm:

```python
class LatencyOptimizedAlgorithm(PathSelectionAlgorithm):
    def select_path(self, source_as, destination_as):
        available_paths = self.path_store.get((source_as, destination_as), [])
        if not available_paths:
            return None

        # Calculate total latency for each path
        path_latencies = []
        for path in available_paths:
            total_latency = 0
            for i in range(len(path) - 1):
                if self.topology.graph.has_edge(path[i], path[i+1]):
                    total_latency += self.topology.graph[path[i]][path[i+1]]['latency']
            path_latencies.append((path, total_latency))

        # Return path with minimum latency
        return min(path_latencies, key=lambda x: x[1])[0]
```

### Example 4: Multiple Traffic Flows

Configure concurrent flows in `traffic.json`:

```json
{
  "duration_ms": 10000,
  "flows": [
    {
      "name": "Flow1",
      "source": "1-ff00:0:111,10.0.0.5",
      "destination": "1-ff00:0:112,172.16.5.5",
      "start_time_ms": 1000,
      "data_size_kb": 5000
    },
    {
      "name": "Flow2",
      "source": "1-ff00:0:112,172.16.5.5",
      "destination": "1-ff00:0:111,10.0.0.5",
      "start_time_ms": 2000,
      "data_size_kb": 3000
    }
  ]
}
```

## Technical Details

### Packet Structure

#### BeaconPacket

```python
class BeaconPacket:
    origin_as_id: str          # Originating AS
    timestamp: float           # Creation time
    hops: List[HopInfo]        # AS-level path information
    segment_type: str          # "down", "core", or "up"
    path: List[str]            # Router-level path (for forwarding)
```

#### HopInfo

```python
class HopInfo:
    as_id: str                 # AS identifier at this hop
    router_id: str             # Border router identifier
    ingress_if: str            # Ingress interface
    egress_if: str             # Egress interface (optional)
    link_metrics: dict         # {"latency": ms, "bandwidth": bytes/ms}
```

### Beaconing Parameters

Modify beaconing behavior in `topology.py`:

```python
BeaconingProcess(
    env,
    start_router,
    path_selection_algorithm,
    interval=1000,  # Beacon interval in ms (default: 1000)
    topology=self
)
```

### Simulation Timing

Default timing in `simulation.py`:

- **Beaconing Phase**: 0-2000ms (configurable in `run()` method)
- **Traffic Phase**: Starts after beaconing, duration from `traffic.json`
- **Beacon Interval**: 1000ms (1 second)

Adjust in `simulation.py`:

```python
def run(self):
    self.topology.initiate_beaconing(self.path_selection_algorithm)
    yield self.env.timeout(5000)  # Wait 5 seconds for path discovery
    # ...
```

### Path Store Format

The `path_store` dictionary structure:

```python
{
    ("1-ff00:0:111", "1-ff00:0:112"): [
        ["1-ff00:0:111-br1-111-1", "1-ff00:0:110-br1-110-1", "1-ff00:0:112-br1-112-1"],
        # Additional paths if available
    ],
    # More AS pairs...
}
```

### Disabling Beaconing (for testing)

To use graph-based path discovery instead of beaconing:

```python
# In main.py or when creating the algorithm
algorithm = ShortestPathAlgorithm(topology, use_beaconing=False)
```

This bypasses beaconing and uses NetworkX to find all paths, useful for:
- Comparing beaconing vs. omniscient path knowledge
- Debugging path selection algorithms
- Baseline performance measurements

## Performance Considerations

### Simulation Speed

- **Beaconing Overhead**: Beacon propagation is realistic but adds events
- **Large Topologies**: O(N�) path combinations in dense networks
- **Packet-Level Simulation**: Each packet is an event

### Optimization Tips

1. **Reduce Beacon Frequency**: Increase interval for faster simulation
2. **Limit Path Discovery Window**: Reduce timeout in `simulation.py`
3. **Use Graph Traversal**: Set `use_beaconing=False` for small tests
4. **Batch Analysis**: Run multiple simulations in parallel

## Troubleshooting

### No Paths Found

**Symptom**: `App: No path found. Stopping.`

**Causes**:
- Beaconing hasn't completed (increase timeout)
- Topology connectivity issue (check link definitions)
- Missing reverse links in topology

**Solution**:
```python
# In simulation.py, increase beaconing time
yield self.env.timeout(5000)  # From 2000 to 5000
```

### Path Registration Not Working

**Symptom**: Empty path store after beaconing

**Debug**:
1. Check beacon sending: Verify core AS has `"core": true`
2. Verify router connections: Ensure bidirectional links
3. Enable debug logging in `beaconing.py` and `components.py`

### Packets Not Forwarding

**Symptom**: Packets sent but not received

**Causes**:
- Path format mismatch (wrong router IDs)
- Host not connected to router
- Missing forwarding logic for destination host

## Dynamic Path Failure Simulation

The framework supports **dynamic path failure events** that can be scheduled at specific simulation times. This enables realistic testing of path selection algorithms under failure conditions.

### Features

- **Configuration-based Events**: Define path down/up events in traffic.json
- **Application Notifications**: Applications are notified when their paths fail
- **Automatic Failover**: Applications can re-select alternative paths
- **Path Recovery**: Paths can be restored at scheduled times
- **Path-level Granularity**: Mark specific router sequences as unavailable

### Quick Example

Add events to your `traffic.json`:

```json
{
  "duration_ms": 10000,
  "flows": [
    {
      "name": "WebServerTraffic",
      "source": "1-ff00:0:111,10.0.0.5",
      "destination": "1-ff00:0:112,172.16.5.5",
      "start_time_ms": 1000,
      "data_size_kb": 5000
    }
  ],
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "path_down",
      "time_ms": 3000,
      "path": ["1-ff00:0:111-br1-111-1", "1-ff00:0:110-br1-110-1", "1-ff00:0:112-br1-112-1"],
      "description": "Primary path failure - simulating link congestion"
    },
    {
      "type": "path_up",
      "time_ms": 7000,
      "path": ["1-ff00:0:111-br1-111-1", "1-ff00:0:110-br1-110-1", "1-ff00:0:112-br1-112-1"],
      "description": "Primary path recovery"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Event Configuration

#### Event Types

- **`path_down`**: Marks a path as unavailable. Path selection algorithms will filter out this path.
- **`path_up`**: Restores a previously failed path, making it available for selection again.

#### Event Fields

- **`type`** (required): Event type - either `"path_down"` or `"path_up"`
- **`time_ms`** (required): Absolute simulation time in milliseconds when the event occurs
- **`path`** (required): Array of router IDs representing the path (must match beaconing format)
- **`description`** (optional): Human-readable description for logging

#### Path Format

Paths must be specified as complete router sequences in the format `"ISD-AS-router"`:

```json
["1-ff00:0:111-br1-111-1", "1-ff00:0:110-br1-110-1", "1-ff00:0:112-br1-112-1"]
```

To find valid paths, run the simulation first and check the "All available paths discovered" output.

### How It Works

#### 1. Event Loading

Events are loaded from `traffic.json` during simulation initialization:

```python
# From simulation.py
self.event_manager = EventManager(
    self.env,
    self.path_selection_algorithm,
    self.app_registry
)
self.event_manager.load_events(scenario)
```

#### 2. Event Scheduling

Events are scheduled as SimPy processes and execute at their designated times:

```python
# From events.py
def schedule_events(self):
    for event in self.events:
        yield self.env.timeout(event['time_ms'] - self.env.now)
        if event['type'] == 'path_down':
            self._execute_path_down(event)
        elif event['type'] == 'path_up':
            self._execute_path_up(event)
```

#### 3. Path Marking

When a `path_down` event occurs:

1. The path is marked unavailable in the path selection algorithm
2. The path selector identifies affected AS pairs
3. Applications using the path are notified via callbacks

```python
# From path_selection.py
def mark_path_down(self, router_path):
    """Mark a specific path as unavailable due to failure."""
    # Store in unavailable_paths dictionary
    # Return list of affected (src_as, dst_as) pairs
```

#### 4. Application Notification

Applications receive a callback when their current path goes down:

```python
# From application.py
def on_path_down(self, router_path):
    """Callback invoked when the current path goes down."""
    print(f"Path down notification received")
    self.is_path_down = True
    self._attempt_path_reselection()
```

#### 5. Path Re-selection

Applications automatically attempt to find alternative paths:

```python
def _attempt_path_reselection(self):
    """Attempt to select a new path after failure."""
    new_path = self.path_selector.select_path(
        self.source.isd_as,
        self.destination.isd_as
    )

    if new_path:
        print(f"Switched to new path: {' -> '.join(new_path)}")
        self.current_path = new_path
        self.is_path_down = False
    else:
        print(f"No alternative path available")
```

### Architecture Components

The path failure system consists of three main components:

#### ApplicationRegistry (app_registry.py)

Tracks which applications are using which paths:

```python
class ApplicationRegistry:
    def register_path_usage(self, application, router_path)
    def notify_path_down(self, router_path, affected_as_pairs)
    def notify_path_up(self, router_path, affected_as_pairs)
```

#### EventManager (events.py)

Manages scheduled path failure events:

```python
class EventManager:
    def load_events(self, config_dict)
    def schedule_events(self)  # SimPy generator
    def _execute_path_down(self, event)
    def _execute_path_up(self, event)
```

#### Path Availability Methods (path_selection.py)

Added to the `PathSelectionAlgorithm` base class:

```python
def mark_path_down(self, router_path)      # Mark path unavailable
def mark_path_up(self, router_path)        # Restore path
def is_path_available(self, router_path)   # Check availability
```

### Example Output

When a path failure event occurs, you'll see output like:

```
[3000.00] EVENT: Path down - ['1-ff00:0:111-br1-111-1', '1-ff00:0:110-br1-110-1', '1-ff00:0:112-br1-112-1']
[3000.00]   Description: Primary path failure - simulating link congestion
Marked path DOWN: ['1-ff00:0:111-br1-111-1', '1-ff00:0:110-br1-110-1', '1-ff00:0:112-br1-112-1']
Affected AS pairs: [('1-ff00:0:111', '1-ff00:0:112')]
[3000.00]   Affected AS pairs: [('1-ff00:0:111', '1-ff00:0:112')]
  Notifying 1 application(s) using this path
[3000.00] App App-WebServerTraffic: Path down notification received
[3000.00] App App-WebServerTraffic: Switched to new path: 1-ff00:0:111-br1-111-1 -> 1-ff00:0:112-br1-112-1
```

If a path recovery event occurs:

```
[7000.00] EVENT: Path up - ['1-ff00:0:111-br1-111-1', '1-ff00:0:110-br1-110-1', '1-ff00:0:112-br1-112-1']
[7000.00]   Description: Primary path recovery
Marked path UP: ['1-ff00:0:111-br1-111-1', '1-ff00:0:110-br1-110-1', '1-ff00:0:112-br1-112-1']
Affected AS pairs: [('1-ff00:0:111', '1-ff00:0:112')]
```

### Testing Scenarios

#### Scenario 1: Single Path Failure with Alternative

```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "path_down",
      "time_ms": 3000,
      "path": ["AS111-router1", "AS110-core", "AS112-router1"],
      "description": "Primary path fails"
    }
  ]
}
```

Application switches to alternative path if available.

#### Scenario 2: Cascading Failures

```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "path_down",
      "time_ms": 3000,
      "path": ["AS111-router1", "AS110-core1", "AS112-router1"]
    },
    {
      "type": "path_down",
      "time_ms": 5000,
      "path": ["AS111-router1", "AS110-core2", "AS112-router1"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Tests behavior when all paths fail.

#### Scenario 3: Failure and Recovery Cycle

```json
{
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "path_down",
      "time_ms": 3000,
      "path": ["AS111-router1", "AS110-core", "AS112-router1"]
    },
    {
      "type": "path_up",
      "time_ms": 7000,
      "path": ["AS111-router1", "AS110-core", "AS112-router1"]
    }
  ]
}
```

Path becomes available again after recovery.

#### Scenario 4: Multiple Concurrent Flows

```json
{
  "flows": [
    {"name": "Flow1", "source": "AS111,host1", "destination": "AS112,host2", "start_time_ms": 1000},
    {"name": "Flow2", "source": "AS111,host1", "destination": "AS113,host3", "start_time_ms": 1000}
  ],
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "path_down",
      "time_ms": 4000,
      "path": ["AS111-router", "AS110-core", "AS112-router"],
      "description": "Affects only Flow1"
    }
  ]
}
```

Only affected applications are notified.

### Edge Cases

#### No Alternative Paths

When all paths fail and no alternatives exist:

```
[3000.00] App App-WebServerTraffic: Path down notification received
[3000.00] App App-WebServerTraffic: No alternative path available
```

The application continues to retry every 10ms until a path becomes available or the simulation ends.

#### Event Before Application Start

If an event occurs before traffic starts:
- The path is marked down in the path selector
- Applications started later will not select the failed path
- No notifications are sent (no apps running yet)

#### Path Recovery Without Failure

If a `path_up` event targets a path that wasn't down:
- The event is processed normally
- No state changes occur
- No errors are raised

### Custom Algorithm Integration

Path selection algorithms automatically respect path availability:

```python
class MyAlgorithm(PathSelectionAlgorithm):
    def select_path(self, source_as, destination_as):
        paths = self.path_store.get((source_as, destination_as), [])

        # Filter unavailable paths automatically
        available = [p for p in paths if self.is_path_available(p)]

        # Your selection logic here
        return my_selection_logic(available)
```

Both `ShortestPathAlgorithm` and `SapexAlgorithm` already filter unavailable paths.

### Performance Metrics with Failures

Track how failures affect performance:

```python
# In simulation.py print_results()
def print_results(self):
    print("\n--- Simulation Results ---")
    print(f"Total Packets Sent: {total_sent}")
    print(f"Total Packets Lost: {total_lost}")
    print(f"Packet Loss Rate: {loss_rate:.2f}%")
    print(f"Average Latency: {avg_latency:.2f}ms")

    # Analyze impact of failures
    if total_lost > 0:
        print(f"\nPackets lost during path failures")
```

### Best Practices

1. **Event Timing**: Schedule events after beaconing completes (after 2000ms)
2. **Path Validation**: Run simulation once to see discovered paths before adding events
3. **Recovery Timing**: Allow sufficient time between failure and recovery
4. **Multiple Events**: Space events apart to observe individual effects
5. **Application Start Time**: Ensure apps start before failure events if testing failover

## Path Probing

The framework supports **active path probing** to measure path latency independently of application traffic. This enables path selection algorithms to gather latency information before sending data or when application traffic is sparse.

### Features

- **Periodic Probing**: Automatically probe paths at configurable intervals
- **Non-intrusive**: Small probe packets (64 bytes) with minimal overhead
- **Round-trip Measurement**: Probes are reflected at destination routers
- **Historical Data**: Maintains sliding window of recent probe measurements
- **Algorithm Integration**: Probe results seamlessly integrate with path selection

### Quick Example

Enable probing in your path selection algorithm:

```python
from path_selection import SapexAlgorithm

# Create algorithm with probing enabled
algorithm = SapexAlgorithm(
    topology,
    use_beaconing=True,
    enable_probing=True,
    probing_interval=1000  # Probe every 1000ms
)
```

### How It Works

#### 1. Probe Packet Structure

Probes are lightweight packets designed for latency measurement:

```python
class ProbePacket(Packet):
    probe_id: str       # Unique identifier
    timestamp: float    # Send time (for RTT calculation)
    is_probe: bool      # Flag to identify probe packets
    rtt: float          # Round-trip time (set on return)
```

#### 2. Probing Process

The probing system operates as a SimPy process that runs periodically:

```python
# From path_selection.py
def probe_paths(self):
    while True:
        yield self.env.timeout(self.probing_interval)

        # Probe all known paths
        for (src_as, dst_as), paths in self.path_store.items():
            for path in paths:
                # Send probe packet
                probe = ProbePacket(source, destination, path, probe_id)
                source_host.send_packet(probe)
```

#### 3. Probe Reflection

Routers at path endpoints reflect probes back to the source:

```python
# From components.py - Router.receive_packet()
if hasattr(packet, 'is_probe') and packet.is_probe:
    if current_hop_index == len(packet.path) - 1:
        # Reverse path and send back
        packet.path = list(reversed(packet.path))
        packet.source, packet.destination = packet.destination, packet.source
        self.ports[next_hop].enqueue(packet)
```

#### 4. RTT Calculation

When probes return, hosts calculate RTT and update the algorithm:

```python
# From components.py - Host.receive_packet()
if hasattr(packet, 'is_probe') and packet.is_probe:
    rtt = self.env.now - packet.timestamp
    packet.rtt = rtt
    self.path_selector.update_probe_result(packet.probe_id, rtt)
```

#### 5. Result Storage

Probe results are stored with a sliding window:

```python
# From path_selection.py
def update_probe_result(self, probe_id, rtt):
    path_tuple, send_time = self.pending_probes[probe_id]

    if path_tuple not in self.probe_results:
        self.probe_results[path_tuple] = []

    self.probe_results[path_tuple].append(rtt)

    # Keep only last 10 measurements
    if len(self.probe_results[path_tuple]) > 10:
        self.probe_results[path_tuple].pop(0)
```

### Enabling Probing

#### Method 1: Algorithm Constructor (Recommended)

Enable probing when creating the algorithm:

```python
# For SapexAlgorithm
algorithm = SapexAlgorithm(
    topology,
    use_beaconing=True,
    enable_probing=True,
    probing_interval=1000  # milliseconds
)
```

#### Method 2: Manual Configuration

Enable probing programmatically:

```python
# After creating algorithm
algorithm.probing_interval = 1000  # Set interval

# In simulation, probing is automatically enabled if interval is set
# The simulation checks for this and starts the probing process
```

### Configuration Parameters

- **`enable_probing`** (bool): Enable/disable probing (default: False)
- **`probing_interval`** (int): Milliseconds between probe cycles (e.g., 1000)
- **Probe packet size**: Fixed at 64 bytes (configured in ProbePacket class)
- **History window**: Last 10 measurements per path (configurable in update_probe_result)

### Using Probe Data in Algorithms

#### Accessing Probe Results

```python
# Get average RTT for a path
avg_latency = self.get_path_latency(router_path)

if avg_latency is not None:
    print(f"Path latency: {avg_latency:.2f}ms")
```

#### SapexAlgorithm Integration

The SapexAlgorithm automatically uses probe data:

```python
def _sync_candidates(self, source_as, destination_as):
    for p in raw_paths:
        if p_key not in self.candidates_map:
            self.candidates_map[p_key] = PathCandidate(p)

            # Use probe data for initial latency
            if self.probing_enabled:
                probe_latency = self.get_path_latency(p)
                if probe_latency is not None:
                    self.candidates_map[p_key].avg_latency = probe_latency
```

#### Custom Algorithm Example

```python
class LatencyAwareAlgorithm(PathSelectionAlgorithm):
    def select_path(self, source_as, destination_as):
        paths = self.path_store.get((source_as, destination_as), [])

        # Filter unavailable paths
        available = [p for p in paths if self.is_path_available(p)]

        # Sort by probed latency
        path_latencies = []
        for path in available:
            latency = self.get_path_latency(path)
            if latency is not None:
                path_latencies.append((path, latency))

        if path_latencies:
            # Return path with lowest probed latency
            return min(path_latencies, key=lambda x: x[1])[0]

        # Fallback to shortest path if no probe data
        return min(available, key=len) if available else None
```

### Probing vs. Application Feedback

The framework supports two methods for gathering path metrics:

| Feature | Probing | Application Feedback |
|---------|---------|---------------------|
| **Timing** | Periodic, independent | On-demand, with traffic |
| **Data** | RTT only | RTT + packet loss |
| **Overhead** | Fixed probe traffic | No extra packets |
| **Availability** | All paths | Only used paths |
| **Use Case** | Initial assessment | Real-time monitoring |

**Best Practice**: Use both together:
- Probing provides initial latency estimates for all paths
- Application feedback provides real-time performance of selected paths
- SapexAlgorithm merges both data sources for optimal decisions

### Example Output

When probing is enabled, you'll see:

```
All available paths discovered:
  Paths from 1-ff00:0:111 to 1-ff00:0:112:
    1: 1-ff00:0:111-br1-111-1 -> 1-ff00:0:110-br1-110-1 -> 1-ff00:0:112-br1-112-1

Path probing enabled with 1000ms interval

[2000.00] Starting applications based on traffic scenario...
[3000.00] Probe cycle: 3 paths probed
[4000.00] Probe cycle: 3 paths probed
```

### Performance Considerations

#### Overhead Analysis

With N paths and probing interval I (ms):
- **Probe rate**: N probes every I milliseconds
- **Bandwidth**: N × 64 bytes every I ms
- **Example**: 10 paths, 1000ms interval = 640 bytes/sec ≈ 5 Kbps

#### Optimization Tips

1. **Adjust Interval**: Longer intervals reduce overhead
   ```python
   probing_interval=5000  # Probe every 5 seconds
   ```

2. **Selective Probing**: Modify `probe_paths()` to probe only candidate paths
   ```python
   # Only probe paths that meet certain criteria
   for path in paths:
       if self.is_candidate_path(path):
           # Send probe
   ```

3. **Adaptive Probing**: Vary interval based on network conditions
   ```python
   # Probe more frequently during instability
   if self.detect_instability():
       self.probing_interval = 500
   else:
       self.probing_interval = 2000
   ```

### Advanced Usage

#### Probe-based Path Discovery

Use probing to validate beaconing-discovered paths:

```python
def validate_path(self, path):
    """Check if path is actually functional via probing"""
    probe_latency = self.get_path_latency(path)

    if probe_latency is None:
        # Path not yet probed
        return True

    # Mark path down if latency is suspiciously high
    if probe_latency > 1000:  # 1 second timeout
        self.mark_path_down(path)
        return False

    return True
```

#### Combining with Path Failure Events

Probing can detect failures before explicit events:

```python
# In your algorithm
def check_probe_health(self):
    """Automatically mark paths down based on probe failures"""
    for path_tuple, measurements in self.probe_results.items():
        if len(measurements) >= 5:
            recent_avg = sum(measurements[-5:]) / 5

            # If latency increased significantly, mark as degraded
            if recent_avg > self.max_latency * 2:
                self.mark_path_down(list(path_tuple))
```

### Troubleshooting

#### No Probe Data Available

**Symptom**: `get_path_latency()` returns None

**Causes**:
- Probing not enabled
- Insufficient time for first probe cycle
- No hosts available in source AS

**Solution**:
```python
# Ensure probing is enabled with interval
algorithm.probing_interval = 1000

# Wait for at least one probe cycle after beaconing
yield self.env.timeout(2000 + 1000)  # beaconing + one probe cycle
```

#### Probes Not Returning

**Symptom**: Probes sent but no RTT measurements

**Causes**:
- Path incorrect or broken
- Router not reflecting probes
- Host not processing probe responses

**Debug**:
- Add logging in Router.receive_packet() for probe handling
- Verify path format matches discovered paths
- Check that hosts have path_selector set

## UMCC: Shared Bottleneck Detection

### Overview

UMCC (Unsupervised Multi-path Congestion Control) is a shared bottleneck detection algorithm that identifies when multiple paths are experiencing congestion due to a common network bottleneck. When detected, the algorithm selects only one representative path that uses the bottleneck to avoid redundant traffic on the congested resource.

This implementation is based on the 2024 research paper on shared bottleneck detection in multipath networks.

### Key Features

- **Automatic Congestion Detection**: Monitors RTT, throughput, and packet loss on all active paths
- **Interface-Level Bottleneck Identification**: Uses SCION Border Router interface IDs to pinpoint exact bottleneck locations
- **Smart Path Selection**: When multiple paths share a bottleneck, keeps only the best performing one
- **Continuous Monitoring**: Repeats detection as network conditions change

### How It Works

#### Algorithm Steps (from the 2024 paper)

1. **Measure Metrics**: Track RTT, throughput, and packet loss on each used path
2. **Detect Degradation**: Watch for packet loss, RTT increases, or throughput decreases
3. **Find Affected Paths**: Identify at least two paths experiencing similar degradation
4. **Assign Interface IDs**: Each SCION Border Router interface gets a globally unique ID (ISD-AS-RouterID)
5. **Compute Intersection**: Build intersection of all interface IDs from affected paths
6. **Filter False Positives**: Remove interfaces that also appear in non-affected paths
7. **Select Representative**: Keep only one path that uses the shared bottleneck
8. **Repeat**: Continue monitoring for additional congestion events

#### Congestion Detection Criteria

A path is considered congested when **at least two** of the following conditions are met:

- **RTT Increase**: Recent RTT > Baseline RTT × 1.5 (50% increase)
- **High Packet Loss**: Loss rate > 5%
- **Throughput Decrease**: Recent throughput < Baseline throughput × 0.7 (30% decrease)

### Configuration

#### Enabling UMCC

UMCC is enabled by default in the SapexAlgorithm. To disable it:

```python
from path_selection import SapexAlgorithm

# Disable UMCC
algorithm = SapexAlgorithm(topology, enable_umcc=False)

# Or enable with custom parameters
algorithm = SapexAlgorithm(
    topology,
    enable_umcc=True,
    enable_probing=True,  # Recommended for better metrics
    probing_interval=1000  # Probe every 1000ms
)
```

#### Adjusting Detection Thresholds

You can customize congestion detection sensitivity by modifying the PathCandidate class:

```python
# In path_selection.py, PathCandidate.detect_congestion()

# More sensitive (detects congestion earlier)
rtt_threshold_increase=1.3    # 30% RTT increase
loss_threshold=0.03           # 3% packet loss
throughput_decrease=0.8       # 20% throughput decrease

# Less sensitive (avoids false positives)
rtt_threshold_increase=2.0    # 100% RTT increase
loss_threshold=0.10           # 10% packet loss
throughput_decrease=0.5       # 50% throughput decrease
```

### Usage Example

#### Creating a Scenario with Shared Bottleneck

To test UMCC, create a topology where multiple paths share a common link:

```
AS 111 ──┬──> AS 110 (Core) ──┬──> AS 113
         │                     │
         └──> AS 112 (Core) ───┘
```

Both paths (111→110→113 and 111→112→113) might share the link 110→113.

**topology.json** (shared bottleneck):
```json
{
  "1-ff00:0:110": {
    "core": true,
    "border_routers": {
      "br1-110-1": {
        "interfaces": [
          {"isd_as": "1-ff00:0:111", "neighbor_router": "br1-111-1", "latency_ms": 5, "bandwidth_mbps": 100},
          {"isd_as": "1-ff00:0:113", "neighbor_router": "br1-113-1", "latency_ms": 10, "bandwidth_mbps": 50}
        ]
      }
    },
    "hosts": {"host1": {"addr": "10.0.0.1"}}
  },
  "1-ff00:0:112": {
    "core": true,
    "border_routers": {
      "br1-112-1": {
        "interfaces": [
          {"isd_as": "1-ff00:0:111", "neighbor_router": "br1-111-1", "latency_ms": 5, "bandwidth_mbps": 100},
          {"isd_as": "1-ff00:0:113", "neighbor_router": "br1-113-1", "latency_ms": 10, "bandwidth_mbps": 50}
        ]
      }
    },
    "hosts": {"host1": {"addr": "10.0.0.2"}}
  }
}
```

#### Simulating Bottleneck Congestion

Use events to create congestion on the shared bottleneck:

**traffic.json**:
```json
{
  "duration_ms": 20000,
  "flows": [
    {
      "name": "Flow1",
      "source": "1-ff00:0:111,10.0.0.5",
      "destination": "1-ff00:0:113,172.16.5.5",
      "start_time_ms": 1000,
      "data_size_kb": 10000
    },
    {
      "name": "Flow2",
      "source": "1-ff00:0:111,10.0.0.6",
      "destination": "1-ff00:0:113,172.16.5.6",
      "start_time_ms": 1000,
      "data_size_kb": 10000
    }
  ],
  "events": [
    {
      "type": "congestion",
      "time_ms": 5000,
      "description": "Simulated congestion on shared bottleneck 110→113"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Expected Output

When UMCC detects a shared bottleneck, you'll see output like:

```
[5000.00] UMCC: Detected congestion on 2 paths
[5000.00] UMCC: Identified shared bottleneck interfaces: {'1-ff00:0:113-br1-113-1'}
[5000.00] UMCC: Excluding path ['1-ff00:0:111-br1-111-1', '1-ff00:0:112-br1-112-1', '1-ff00:0:113-br1-113-1'] due to shared bottleneck
[5000.00] App App-Flow2: Switched to alternative path
```

### Implementation Details

#### Per-Path Metrics Tracking

Each PathCandidate object tracks:

```python
class PathCandidate:
    # RTT tracking
    latency_history = []        # Last 10 RTT measurements
    avg_latency = 1000.0        # Running average

    # Loss tracking
    packet_loss_count = 0
    packets_sent = 0

    # Throughput tracking
    throughput_history = []     # Last 10 measurements (Mbps)
    bytes_received = 0
    last_throughput_time = 0

    # Congestion state
    is_congested = False
    congestion_start_time = None
    shared_bottleneck_interfaces = set()
```

#### Interface ID Assignment

SCION Border Router interfaces are identified by their full router ID:

```python
def get_interface_ids(self):
    """Extract interface IDs from router path"""
    interface_ids = set()
    for router_id in self.router_path:
        # Router ID format: "1-ff00:0:110-br1-110-1"
        # This serves as the interface ID
        interface_ids.add(router_id)
    return interface_ids
```

#### Bottleneck Detection Algorithm

```python
def detect_shared_bottlenecks(self, active_paths):
    # Step 1-2: Detect congested paths
    congested_paths = [p for p in active_paths if p.detect_congestion()]

    if len(congested_paths) < 2:
        return []  # Need at least 2 paths

    # Step 3-5: Find common interfaces
    common_interfaces = congested_paths[0].get_interface_ids()
    for path in congested_paths[1:]:
        common_interfaces = common_interfaces.intersection(path.get_interface_ids())

    # Step 6: Remove interfaces in non-congested paths
    for path in non_congested_paths:
        common_interfaces = common_interfaces - path.get_interface_ids()

    # Step 7: Return bottleneck
    return [common_interfaces] if common_interfaces else []
```

### Performance Considerations

#### Computational Complexity

- **Congestion Detection**: O(n) where n = number of active paths
- **Interface Intersection**: O(m × p) where m = paths, p = path length
- **Overall**: O(n × m × p) - efficient for typical SCION path counts

#### Memory Usage

- **Per Path**: ~500 bytes (10 RTT samples + 10 throughput samples + metadata)
- **100 Paths**: ~50 KB total memory overhead

#### Timing Considerations

- **Metrics Collection**: Real-time (per packet)
- **Throughput Update**: Every 100ms window
- **Congestion Detection**: Every path selection (on-demand)
- **Minimum Detection Time**: Need 3+ RTT samples (~3-30 packets depending on send rate)

### Advanced Usage

#### Combining with Path Probing

UMCC works best with path probing enabled for accurate baseline metrics:

```python
algorithm = SapexAlgorithm(
    topology,
    enable_umcc=True,
    enable_probing=True,
    probing_interval=500  # More frequent probing for faster detection
)
```

#### Custom Congestion Detection

Extend PathCandidate to implement custom detection logic:

```python
class CustomPathCandidate(PathCandidate):
    def detect_congestion(self):
        # Custom logic: detect based on jitter
        if len(self.latency_history) < 3:
            return False

        jitter = max(self.latency_history[-3:]) - min(self.latency_history[-3:])
        return jitter > 50  # High jitter threshold
```

#### Multi-Bottleneck Scenarios

UMCC handles multiple independent bottlenecks:

```python
# Step 8: Repeat for additional congestion
bottlenecks = detect_shared_bottlenecks(filtered_paths)
# Returns: [
#     {'1-ff00:0:110-br1-110-1'},  # Bottleneck 1
#     {'1-ff00:0:112-br1-112-2'}   # Bottleneck 2
# ]
```

### Troubleshooting

#### No Bottleneck Detection

**Symptom**: UMCC doesn't detect obvious bottleneck

**Causes**:
- Insufficient traffic to trigger congestion metrics
- Thresholds too high
- Less than 2 paths affected
- Paths don't share common interfaces

**Solution**:
```python
# Lower detection thresholds
candidate.detect_congestion(
    rtt_threshold_increase=1.2,  # 20% increase
    loss_threshold=0.02,          # 2% loss
    throughput_decrease=0.8       # 20% decrease
)

# Ensure sufficient traffic
data_size_kb=10000  # Large transfer to accumulate metrics
```

#### False Positive Detection

**Symptom**: UMCC detects bottleneck when paths are independent

**Causes**:
- Network-wide congestion affecting all paths equally
- Thresholds too sensitive
- Insufficient filtering of common interfaces

**Solution**:
```python
# Raise thresholds
rtt_threshold_increase=1.8  # Require 80% RTT increase
loss_threshold=0.08         # 8% loss threshold

# Verify path independence in topology
# Ensure paths don't actually share bottleneck links
```

#### Metrics Not Updating

**Symptom**: `throughput_history` or `latency_history` empty

**Causes**:
- No traffic on path
- update_path_feedback() not called
- Packet size not passed correctly

**Debug**:
```python
# Add logging in update_path_feedback
print(f"Updating feedback: path={router_path}, latency={latency_sample}, loss={is_loss}")

# Verify application calls feedback
if hasattr(self.path_selector, 'update_path_feedback'):
    self.path_selector.update_path_feedback(packet.path, latency, False, packet.size)
```

### Limitations

1. **Requires Active Traffic**: Needs packet exchanges to detect congestion (passive paths not monitored)
2. **Detection Latency**: Requires 3+ measurements before detection possible
3. **False Positives**: Network-wide events may trigger incorrect bottleneck identification
4. **Interface Granularity**: Detection at router level, not link level

### Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to UMCC:

1. **Adaptive Thresholds**: Automatically adjust based on network conditions
2. **Machine Learning**: Use ML models for congestion prediction
3. **Path Quality Scores**: Incorporate bottleneck information into path scoring
4. **Explicit Congestion Notification**: Support ECN marks for faster detection
5. **Hierarchical Bottlenecks**: Detect bottlenecks at multiple network layers

## Contributing

To extend the framework:

1. **New Metrics**: Modify `application.py` to track additional statistics
2. **Complex Topologies**: Add multi-core or hierarchical AS structures
3. **Advanced Beaconing**: Implement beacon filtering, expiration, updates
4. **QoS Features**: Add bandwidth reservation or priority queuing
5. **Failure Simulation**: Extend event types (link-level, router-level, AS-level failures)
6. **Automatic Failure Detection**: Trigger path_down based on loss/latency thresholds
